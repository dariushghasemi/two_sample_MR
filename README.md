# two_sample_MR
A two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis during Dianne's stay at Eurac Research

- The genes were looked up across summary stats of the deCODE study to find the pQTL variants in each gene (Tue 18:30, 14-Nov-23).

- The filtered variants were queried on GTEx v.8 and the resulting eQTLs were stored (Thu 16:30, 16-Nov-23).

- Practical example of one-sample MR postponed to Monday (18:20, 17-Nov-23).

- Git version control was convered. In addtion, we queried the variants in other genes in GTEx for tissue specific eQTLs for the vicinity genes (Mon, 19:00, 20-Nov-23).
