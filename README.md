# two_sample_MR
A two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis during Dianne's stay at Eurac Research

- The genes were looked up across summary stats of the deCODE study to find the pQTL variants in each gene (Tue 18:30, 14-Nov-23).

- The filtered variants were queried on GTEx v.8 and the resulting eQTLs were stored (Thu 16:30, 16-Nov-23).
